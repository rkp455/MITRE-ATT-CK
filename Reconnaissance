# Tactic - Reconnaissance - ID: TA0043

**Created:** 02 October 2020  
**Last Modified:** 18 October 2020

The adversary is trying to gather information they can use to plan future operations. Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. Such information may include details of the victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel. This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute Initial Access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance efforts.

## Technique

### Active Scanning - ID: T1595

Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that can be used during targeting. Active scans are those where the adversary probes victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance that do not involve direct interaction.  
Adversaries may perform different forms of active scanning depending on what information they seek to gather. These scans can also be performed in various ways, including using native features of network protocols such as ICMP.[1][2] Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (e.g., Search Open Websites/Domains or Search Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (e.g., Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (e.g., External Remote Services or Exploit Public-Facing Application).

#### Sub-technique of: T1595

### Active Scanning: Scanning IP Blocks - ID: T1595.001

Adversaries may scan victim IP blocks to gather information that can be used during targeting. Public IP addresses may be allocated to organizations by block, or a range of sequential addresses.  
Adversaries may scan IP blocks in order to Gather Victim Network Information, such as which IP addresses are actively in use as well as more detailed information about hosts assigned these addresses. Scans may range from simple pings (ICMP requests and responses) to more nuanced scans that may reveal host software/versions via server banners or other network artifacts.[1] Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (e.g., Search Open Websites/Domains or Search Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (e.g., Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (e.g., External Remote Services).

### Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning - ID: T1595.002

Adversaries may scan victims for vulnerabilities that can be used during targeting. Vulnerability scans typically check if the configuration of a target host/application (e.g., software and version) potentially aligns with the target of a specific exploit the adversary may seek to use.  
These scans may also include more broad attempts to Gather Victim Host Information that can be used to identify more commonly known, exploitable vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans typically harvest running software and version numbers via server banners, listening ports, or other network artifacts.[1] Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (e.g., Search Open Websites/Domains or Search Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (e.g., Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (e.g., Exploit Public-Facing Application).

### Active Scanning: Wordlist Scanning - ID: T1595.003

Adversaries may iteratively probe infrastructure using brute-forcing and crawling techniques. While this technique employs similar methods to Brute Force, its goal is the identification of content and infrastructure rather than the discovery of valid credentials. Wordlists used in these scans may contain generic, commonly used names and file extensions or terms specific to a particular software. Adversaries may also create custom, target-specific wordlists using data gathered from other Reconnaissance techniques (e.g., Gather Victim Org Information, or Search Victim-Owned Websites).

For example, adversaries may use web content discovery tools such as Dirb, DirBuster, and GoBuster and generic or custom wordlists to enumerate a website’s pages and directories.[1] This can help them to discover old, vulnerable pages or hidden administrative portals that could become the target of further operations (e.g., Exploit Public-Facing Application or Brute Force).

As cloud storage solutions typically use globally unique names, adversaries may also use target-specific wordlists and tools such as s3recon and GCPBucketBrute to enumerate public and private buckets on cloud infrastructure.[2][3] Once storage objects are discovered, adversaries may leverage Data from Cloud Storage to access valuable information that can be exfiltrated or used to escalate privileges and move laterally.

Information about hosts may include a variety of details, including administrative data (e.g., name, assigned IP, functionality, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its configuration (e.g., operating system, language, etc.).  
Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via Active Scanning or Phishing for Information. Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.[1] Information about hosts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (e.g., Social Media or Search Victim-Owned Websites). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (e.g., Search Open Websites/Domains or Search Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (e.g., Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (e.g., Supply Chain Compromise or External Remote Services).
